There are countless useful and life-saving resources for Digital Text Analysis and Computational Literary Studies out there - though it's sometimes hard to find them (again). Here are some of my favourites:

##### Stylometry & Text Analytics
Data Science Dojo Youtube series on [Text Analytics with R](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vuw0AsHeGw&t=232s)

##### R & R-Packages
[R Code - Best practices](https://www.r-bloggers.com/r-code-best-practices/)<br>
[Writing an R package from scratch](https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/)<br>
For a more thorough discussions packages and their architecture, have a look at Hadley Wickham's [R packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/)<br>
Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund's [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is an unbelievably valuable resource for reading up on some R basics.<br>
Hadley Wickham [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/)<br>
For non-programmers Garrett Grolemund's [Hands-On Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/)<br>
[R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/)<br>
[An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)<br>
In general, [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/) is a great place when you are looking for some tutorials on machine learning in both R & python - the [R Machine Learning Mini-Course](https://machinelearningmastery.com/r-machine-learning-mini-course/) is especially helpful for absolute beginners who want a step-by-step guide to their first model.<br>

##### GitHub Pages
This [tutorial](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages) by Amanda Visconti helped me enormously to created this website. I use the design template [So Simple](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme), which is not only easy to use, but also already comes with a nice structure for blogs posts.
