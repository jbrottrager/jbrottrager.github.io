After many hours, days, and months of work, I have finished my first R package, stylcoR. It allows you to recreate the analyses I've conducted for my MA thesis. You can find it at [here](https://github.com/jbrottrager/stylcoR).

Please let me know if you find any bugs or if you have any suggestions about any functions I should add.
