As a part of my MA thesis, I am writing a R package called stylcoR, which is designed to facilitate digital text analysis of (literary) corpora. It enables a comparative statistical approach: Subsets in a corpus - texts belonging to a certain genre, for example - can be compared statistically and in (un)supervised machine learning methods. You can find it at [here](https://github.com/jbrottrager/stylcoR).
