Hi, I’m Judith Brottrager, a Postdoc at TU Darmstadt working at the intersection of digital humanities and literary studies. My research focuses on quantitative approaches to literary history, canonisation processes, and cultural analytics, using methods such as text analysis, word embeddings, and network analysis.
