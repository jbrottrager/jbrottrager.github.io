Hi, I'm Judith Brottrager and I'm a PhD researcher at the TU Darmstadt. I hold bachelor's degrees in Comparative Literature and English and American Studies (University of Vienna) and a master's degree in Linguistic and Literary Computing (TU Darmstadt). As a proud member of the DFG Priority Programme [Computational Literary Studies](https://dfg-spp-cls.github.io/), I'm currently working on my PhD thesis on issues of canonisation in English and German literary history.<br><br>

If youâ€™d like to reach out, you can email me at judith.brottrager(at)tu-darmstadt.de<br><br>
